# Assets Directory

Place your logo and other assets here.

## Adding Your Logo

1. **Supported formats:** PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, WEBP
2. **Recommended size:** 200-300px width, transparent background preferred
3. **File naming:** Name your logo file as `logo.png` (or `logo.jpg`, `logo.svg`, etc.)

### Steps:
1. Place your logo file in this directory (`frontend/assets/`)
2. Name it `logo.png` (or one of the supported formats)
3. The app will automatically detect and display it

## Example:
```
frontend/
  assets/
    logo.png    ← Your logo here
    logo.jpg    ← Or this
    logo.svg    ← Or this
```

The app will automatically use the first logo file it finds.
